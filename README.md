# Cool effects for lighting consoles!

This is a project that allows people to create complex lighting effects based on user input that simulates drums and other instruments. Just tap to the beat!

## Where?

None of your business.

## What?

Read the above.

## When?

Irrelevant question.

## Why?

Creating complex lighting effects that go along with instruments, especially drums, becomes exponentially difficult as they become more complex. Want to match a cool drum beat exactly? Previously, you basically couldn't. With this software, the only thing holding you back is your ability to stay on beat.

## How?

The thought behind this project stems from Fourier analysis. Thinking of drums and other instruments with hits that are like the roots of a complex wave makes things much easier to work with. The "roots" are connected based on their occurences and synced together to get the most accurate values possible for effects. Effect settings are calculated and displayed for the user.
